Here is the complete implementation for the `same_chars` function:

```
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    """
    # Count the characters in each string
    count_s0 = {}
    count_s1 = {}
    
    for char in s0:
        count_s0[char] = count_s0.get(char, 0) + 1
        
    for char in s1:
        count_s1[char] = count_s1.get(char, 0) + 1
        
    # Check if the character counts are the same
    return count_s0 == count_s1
```

You can copy and paste this function definition into your code to use it for checking if two words have the same characters. It works by counting the characters in each string and then comparing the counts to determine if they have the same characters.
